Team Members: Shelby Osteen and Alina Hashmi

Project Log:

Project =>
 Implemented a user-input based web application to let students in high rise dorms know when washer and dryers are available. Users select the dorm they correspond to and after authorizing a valid UGA google account, are taken to a web page with the current availability washers and dryers for them to check as in/ out of use. 

Friday =>
 Came up with the idea that tracked which washers and dryers are in use at the freshmen high-rise dorms.
 Started working on individual pages. 
 Struggles to come up with design ideas but decided on a responsive CSS style design using sliding elements.
 Learned different elements in HTML that can be used to build our project. We also learned about many different ways to make a responsive and creative CSS design while picking the best one for our project.

Saturday => 
 Each person implemented their own corresponding pages of the webdesign.
 Was challenged with implementing meaningful parts that would not impact other's designs.
 Made sure to make changes based on specific classes in CSS rather then overarching elements to allow for individual changes that don't affect all web pages.
 Also worked with trying to create a button that switches colors.

Sunday => 
 Deciding on auth0 as an authorization method, created an application within auth0 to implement within our web page and linked this using JavaScript. 
 Implemented a function to check if an email address ends with uga.edu before validating.
 Learned what an authorization for a web page included and how to implement one using auth0 into a simple web page using javascript with restrictions

Used =>
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Auth0
